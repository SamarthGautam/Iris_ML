# Iris_ML
Predicting the type of Iris flower.

![Iris_Flower](https://github.com/SamarthGautam/Iris_ML/blob/main/Iris.jpg)

By traning a machine learning algorithm, we will make prediction between the types of iris species.

There we will try to predict the Sepal length, Petal length, Sepal width, Petal width.

By which we will get the class of flower as an output.
